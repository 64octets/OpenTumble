OpenTumble
==========

An open-source coin tumbler for Bitcoin to enable enhanced personal anonymity and security.

Motivation
----------

The goal of OpenTumble is to provide an open and free framework for running a Bitcoin tumbling service. By tumbling
Bitcoins, the eventual recipient of the tumbled coins is unaware of the source of those coins, and the sender of the
coins is provided with plausibile deniability as to the actual recipient of the coins. By running his or her own
tumbler, based on open source code, the user of that tumbler does not need to rely on promises of security or anonymity
from another party.

Bitcoin tumbling provides security and anonymity for Bitcoin transactions, which may be of value to persons living in
governments without strong human rights, to or anyone who wishes to enhance the security of his or her Bitcoin
transactions.
